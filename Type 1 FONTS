 
Tex/LaTeX generated PostScript files utilize Type 3 Computer Modern fonts, which are installed by default. Type 3 fonts render good results on high-resolution printers, but look fuzzy on computer displays and thermal printers. On the other hand, Type 1 fonts are scalable, look great on any screen and provide the highest possible quality printout on all kinds of printers.

CM-Super package, which contains Type 1 Computer Modern font, is freely available from CTAN’s Comprehensive TeX Archive. However, most GNU/Linux distributions already provide cm-super package from their default package repositories, just use the distributions’ default package management system to install the package. When creating PDF files, GhostScript and pdfTeX will embed Type 1 fonts if they are available, otherwise they will use Type 3 fonts.
